    <h2>Experiments</h2>
    <p>I am devoting a section of my site to "experiments"â€”little "what if's" and prototypes of ideas. They aren't big enough to turn into apps or tools, nor do I want to spend the time to fully integrate them into my main site. They are independent, atomic, and fun. The point is to be non-committal and give me a chance to try out new things then throw them away.</p>
