I'm a big fan of Spotify Wrapped. It is really fun to see what how I _actually_ spend my time, rather than just how I _think_ I spend it—the age old "states preference" versus "revealed preference". It's statistics, but unmotiviating, harmless statistics. In recent years, many platforms have started to aggregate some of the data from your usage. 

# Books

I almost exclusively read on my Kindle, and for the first time, I tried to record what I read on Goodreads. So this is the first year that I have decent stats on what books I read. There are a few recording errors and missing books, but Goodreads is close enough.

Overall, I read **57 books** and **26,126 pages**. There was a paternity leave in there in which I read over half of those books.

</details>

I recommend and enjoyed almost every single book I read to some degree, but here are 5 that I think particularly stood out as particularly engaging or well-written, in no particular order.

_The Sword of Kaigen_ by M.L. Wang. A society of elite warriors navigate generational trauma, misinformation, isolation, and duty.

![[51057191.jpg]]

_Jade Legacy_ (Green Bone Saga #3) by Fonda Lee. A crime family wades through their personal values on family, legacy, and revenge

![[65213543.jpg]]

_Bookshops & Bonedust_ (Legends & Lattes #0) by Travis Baldree. A big bad orc warrior has to settle down in a small coast town and finds romance and helps to revive an old bookshop

# Videogames

Gaming is spread out across multiple platforms, including emulation, PlayStation, Nintendo Switch, and PC via Steam, Epic, Ubisoft, and others.

* **PlayStation 5** reports that I played 112 hours across 23 different games.
* **Steam** reports that I played X hours across X different games. TODO: Update when you have access to a browser console (https://www.reddit.com/r/Steam/comments/18i559l/total_hours_played_per_year/)
* **Nintendo** reports that I played 35 hours across 7 different games.

Stand-out games that I played include:

* **God of War Ragnarök** is a perfect cinematic game about punching your problems away and learning to trust and hug.
* **Star Wars: Jedi Survivor** is about jumping, dodging, and slicing while hiding from the local fauna.
* **Golf With Your Friends** is a wonderful party game that you can play with anyone.
* **Tunic** is a great Zelda-like action RPG that both benefits and is hindered by the creative game manual, which you discover during the game and is written in a language that you can't read.
* **Balatro** isn't a poker game.

# Board games

I don't have good stats on what I did play, but I had a night almost every week where I played some form of board game, often a brand new one. Some favorites

- [**Kingdomino**](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/204583/kingdomino) is a small game about organizing your tiles in an efficient manner into a kingdom. Perfect for those who futz.
- [**Sagrada**](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/199561/sagrada) is a game about organizing your dice efficiently into a stained glass window.
- [**Clank!**](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/201808/clank-a-deck-building-adventure) is a game about organizing your tiles _inefficiently_ (to your advantage but to your opponent's disadvantage) while exploring a dragon's lair quietly and in search of loot.

I know that they are technically "board games", but I still do the New York Times Wordle, Connections, and Mini Crossword every single day. The Mini Crossword is my favorite and it makes me feel clever.

# Other things

I am slowing refining my personal style. It hovers somewhere between prep/ivy and workwear. Really I just want to wear wool sweaters and giant coats every single day, but that doesn't really work in the summer. At the beginning of November, I started posting my outfit on a daily basis on [my Mastodon account](https://mastodon.social/@Literallyacar). It's helped me be more intentional in what I wear.

I also started regularly contributing to social media (Mastodon, again) for the first time since high school. The reason I started is not really clear. Maybe I just wanted to complain more? That seems like what most people use it for. 

My first side useful side project was launched. [Yazzy](https;//yazzy.fly.dev) is a reader-mode and archival tool. I built it because 1. some sites are really hard to read, 2. I wanted the quick, AI-generated summaries that Arc Browser generates to be available on my phone, and 3. I wanted to be able to save articles into my Obsidian vault for future reference. It's a useful project and I even have a few friends that also find it useful. I wouldn't say that it's a "learn something new" project, but it is nice to have shipped "something" even though if it is only a small something that is probably only a few man hours for someone with that sigma grindset.
