# In and Out
- ðŸ“¤ Out
	- Polyester
	- Viewing myself as a burden.
	- Doing things out of a sense of obligation instead of utility and joy
	- Cupcakes. They just aren't good. Brownies are better.
	- Trying to smoke meat on a charcoal grill
- ðŸ“¥ In
	- Things made of wool, wood, and leather
	- Viewing myself as a benefit
	- Writing
	- Fit pics ðŸ“¸
	- Hats
	- Books outside of sci-fi and fantasy

- Never left
	- Quality over quantity
	- Elevated essentials
	- Big jackets
	- Tasty food
	- Dark chocolate
	- Being a dad

_God of War RagnarÃ¶k_ is a big, cinematic game about punching things and being a father. What's not to like? I really enjoyed the beautiful visuals, the weightiness of the combat, and the wide variety of enemies (which was an issue I had with the first game).

In _The Sword of Kaigen_ by M.L. Wang, a society of elite warriors navigate generational trauma, misinformation, isolation, and duty. It was a kind of story (about family relationships from the multiple simultaneous view points) and I enjoyed how the fantastical fictional aspects created something that we all can related to even though we can't control individual water molecules and air pressure.

_Gathering Moss_ by Robin Wall Kimmerer is aboutâ€¦ moss. It's about moss, but in a cozy and sometimes-philosophical way.

[Astropilot](https://astropilot.bandcamp.com/) is an electronic ambient artist. I listen to his stuff while working and it pairs perfectly with rain sounds. His music makes me feel futuristic and peaceful.
