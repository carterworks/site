To create is to recreate.

> Immature poets imitate; mature poets steal; bad poets deface what they take, and good poets make it into something better, or at least something different. The good poet welds his theft into a whole of feeling which is unique, utterly different from that from which it was torn; the bad poet throws it into something which has no cohesion.

T. S. Eliot, _The Sacred Wood_ (1920)

> If you wish to make an apple pie from scratch, you must first invent the universe.

Carl Sagan, _Cosmos: A Personal Voyage_, Episode 9 (1980)

> No man is an island, entire of itself; every man is a piece of the continent, a part of the main. 
 
John Donne, "Devotions upon Emergent Occasions", _Meditation XVII_ (1624)
