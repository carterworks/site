[Simon Willison, "My approach to running a link blog", 2024-12-22](https://simonwillison.net/2024/Dec/22/link-blog/)

Going to try this out.

> The point of that article was to emphasize that blogging doesn’t have to be about unique insights. The value is in writing frequently and having something to show for it over time—worthwhile even if you don’t attract much of an audience (or any audience at all).
> 
> In that article I proposed two categories of content that are low stakes and high value: **things I learned** and **descriptions of my projects**.
> 
> I realize now that link blogging deserves to be included a third category of low stakes, high value writing. We could think of that category as **things I’ve found**.
> 
> That’s the purpose of my link blog: it’s an ongoing log of things I’ve found—effectively a combination of public bookmarks and my own thoughts and commentary on why those things are interesting.
