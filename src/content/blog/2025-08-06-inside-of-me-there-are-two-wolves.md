Inside of me there are two wolves. One of them is named DIY, who says "build everything from scratch. Only you know what you need. You will learn the most this way." The other wolf is the do-work wolf, who says "use what's already been built. It's easier and you can focus on the important stuff. 'You're not a beautiful and unique snowflake'... By giving up vain individuality, you can leapfrog the toils of mundane decisions, and make faster progress in areas that really matter" (from [The Ruby on Rails Doctrine](https://rubyonrails.org/doctrine#convention-over-configuration)).

## Linux

**July 17**: I wipe my Windows 11 PC and install [Bazzite](https://bazzite.gg), a version of Fedora Silverblue optimized for gaming. I pick it because it has excellent out-of-the-box support for Nvidia GPUs and Fedora Silverblue's immutable nature ensures that everything will probably never be broken.

**Today**: I wipe my Bazzite PC and install [Omarchy](https://omarchy.org), "an opinionated Arch + Hyprland Setup by DHH". I picked it because of the pre-setup tiling window manager and all the little utilities.

**Today+3 hours**: Should I wipe my Omarchy PC and install [NixOS](https://nixos.org) and recreate Omarchy from the ground up, because I don't like that Omarchy/Arch was missing Flatpaks, how it used Chromium instead of [Zen Browser](https://zen-browser.app), and Arch still feels like a scary mountain of technical debt the second I think about it. Example: the first time I rebooted, it went to the rootfs safety console because... no one knows.
